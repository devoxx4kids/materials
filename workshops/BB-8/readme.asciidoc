[[How_To_Use_Tickle]]
== How to use Tickle

When you launch Tickle, you should see:

* A screen titled "`My Projects`". This is where you will be able to see all of your Tickle projects once you make them. 
* A button in the top-right corner that says "`+ New Project`".
* Some demo projects - don't worry about these.

=== Make a new project

. Click on the "`+ New Project`" button. 
. A screen titled "`Choose a Template`" will show up; tap on "`BB-8`". 
. You will see some sample code - drag the block at the top (it says "`When starting to play`") into the blocks at the left to delete it.
. At the top-left corner, you will see a blue button that looks like three lines stacked on top of each other. Click on this button to go to the "`My Projects`" page.
. At the bottom of the rectangle for your project, you will see an orange button that looks like "`...`". Click on this, and the project will flip over to show some options.
. Click "`RENAME`" and type in the name of your project. Once you are done, click on the blue check mark.
. Press the "`X`" at the bottom of the project to un-flip the project.
. Tap on the project picture (a wavy background by default) to go inside the project.

=== Add code to a project

* If you aren't already in the project's *code window*, find the project in the "`My Projects`" page and tap on its picture.
* You will see a *list of blocks* at the left of your screen with 6 categories next to it. Tap on a category to navigate to it. You can also swipe up and down on the list to navigate.
* To *add a block* to the code, drag it from the list of blocks into the large, dark gray area on the right of your screen.
* To *connect two blocks together*, align them until a white line shows up in between them. This is where the block you are dragging will connect to the block that has been placed down.
* A block that is between two other blocks *cannot be moved by itself*. If you are moving a block, you must move everything connected underneath it as well. If you want to move a specific block, you can move a stack of blocks out, then replace everything except the first block.
* To *delete a block or a stack of blocks*, drag it into the block list.
* *Always start a stack of blocks with a "`starting block`"* - starting blocks are the ones with a rounded top. Whenever the event written on the starting block happens, the stack of blocks underneath will execute.
* *Some code blocks have values that can be changed.* These values include: numbers, text, etc. To change these values, tap on the box with the value and type in a new value.
** Blocks like `... + ...` and `ask ... and wait` *require variables or text input*.
** If *tapping on the box does nothing*, that means the box requires a block to go inside it. Blocks that go inside other blocks have rounded edges and are usually conditional statements (think of them as yes/no questions).
*** Blocks like `if ... then` `wait until ...` *require conditional statements*. These include `... = ...` (true when the two values are equal, false when they aren't), `finger touching down?` (true when finger is touching the stage, false when it isn't), and others.
* To *add a variable* to the project, tap the "`+ Add Variable`" button at the bottom-left of your screen. Choose "`[x] Variable`", name it, and select "`For all objects`". Sometimes for other projects, you will want variables to be "`For this object`", but in this workshop, all variables are for all objects. Once you have named the variable, tap "`CREATE`".
** This will make a *new category, titled "`Data`"*, appear in the list of categories at the side. This category deals with variables and lists.

=== Add new character to the project

. Tap the button that has a "`+`" symbol with the word "`Add`" written underneath it (located at the top-right of your screen).
. A window will pop up with two categories: devices and characters. Devices is useful if you want to add more physical electronics to the project, but you want to add a character into the project. Browse through the "`All Characters`" section and find one you like.
. When you find one you like, tap it and it will be added to the project. At the top, where the BB-8 icon is shown, your new character should also be shown. Tap on character and device icons to go to that character/device's code. 
. Tap on a character/device's

=== Before testing a project

. Look at the top middle of your screen. You should see a BB-8 icon. If it has a red question mark next to it, continue with these steps; otherwise, try out the project.
. If you are not in the BB-8's code window (i.e. you are in a different character's window), tap on the BB-8 icon once to go to the BB-8's code window. Tap on the BB-8 icon (again if you just navigated to the code window; for the first time if you didn't) - a window will show up that has a radar thing at the bottom. This will search for BB-8's nearby and connect to them. Place the BB-8 robot near the mobile device.
. Once a BB-8 is found, a BB-8 icon will show up in place of the radar, with a name underneath it. Click on the icon to connect to the BB-8.
. After the BB-8 has been connected to, it should light up with a blue color.

=== Testing a project

. Follow the instructions in the "`Try it!`" section of the activity.
.. To start the project, tap on the green "`play`" button near the top-left of your screen. This will start the project and make BB-8 move and act accordingly.

=== Other notes

. Before testing a project, you will want to aim him towards you. Tap on BB-8's icon to go to his code view. At the bottom-right corner of your screen, you should see a Sphero icon with arrows going around it. This button is used to aim BB-8. Hold down your finger on that button, and a circle should appear. Move your finger around the circle, and you should see a blue light in BB-8 move around as well. Manipulate the circle until the blue light is facing towards you. This is very important because BB-8 bases all of his directions off of how he is aimed.
. If anything is still confusing to you, there is a help window built into Tickle. Tap the button that looks like a question mark in a circle (at the top-left of your screen) to access this help window.

== Activities

The description of these activities includes a brief description of the activity, the final code, and how to test it. If you need help with the project, refer to the <<How_To_Use_Tickle>> section for instructions on how to add code or characters to the project.

[[Activity_1]]
=== 1. Run from the Stormtroopers

==== Description

The stormtroopers are trying to capture BB-8! He has to go fast and use evasive maneuvers to outrun them.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_1_final>>.

.Activity 1 finished code
image::images/workshop-1-final.png[height=50%]

==== Try it!

. Find a long space with lots of room for BB-8 to go forwards - this activity involves a lot of movement (for BB-8).
. Start the project!
. BB-8 should move forwards, turn right for 45 degrees, move forwards some more, turn left for 90 degrees, then move forwards some more.

[[Activity_2]]
=== 2. Escaped!

==== Description

BB-8 has escaped the pursuing stormtroopers, and he is very happy, so he is doing a victory dance.

==== Final Code

.Activity 2 finished code
image::images/workshop-2-final.png[height=50%]

==== Try it!

. This activity does not require a very large space, but you do need some space for BB-8 to move around in. Find a reasonable amount of space.
. Start the project!
, BB-8 should start spinning around and randomly moving all over the place - he gets very excited while performing his victory dance.

[[Activity_3]]
=== 3. Remote Reconnaissance

==== Description

Even though BB-8 has escaped the stormtroopers, he is stuck on an unknown planet. He is letting you take control for a bit to do some exploring.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_3_final>>. The word "`iPad`" will be replaced with the name of your mobile device (unless it is an iPad, in which case it will stay as "`iPad`").

.Activity 3 finished code
image::images/workshop-3-final.png[height=50%]

==== Try it!

. Find a place with some obstacles to maneuver around.
. Start the project!
. Tilt your device forwards to move BB-8 forwards. Tilt your device left or right to make BB-8 turn left or right, respectively.

[[Activity_4]]
=== 4. Exploring

==== Description

BB-8 is doing some more exploring, but this time, he is doing it by himself.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_4_final>>.

[[workshop_4_final]]
.Activity 4 finished code
image::images/workshop-4-final.png[height=50%]

==== Try it!

. BB-8 will move around the area, and whenever he bumps into something, he will turn away from it and move somewhere else.

[[Activity_5]]
=== 5. Speedometer

==== Description

The Resistance is testing out a new, color-coded speedometer in BB-8.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_5_final_1>> and <<workshop_5_final_2>>. There is a bit of overlap between the two images; use this to see where the first one ends and the second one starts.

==== Try it!

. Find a place similar to that of activity <<Activity_1>> - that is, a long and possibly narrow space.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 will move back and forth four times, each time with a different speed. Depending on his speed, he will be colored, from lowest to highest speed, red, orange, yellow, or green.

[[Activity_6]]
=== 6. Party!!!

==== Description

The Resistance has a party after blowing up an Imperial Stardestroyer, and BB-8 is showing off his dance moves.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_6_final_1>> and <<workshop_6_final_2>>. There is a bit of overlap between the two images; use this to see where the first one ends and the second one starts.

==== Try it!

. Find any reasonably large area for this project.
. Start the project!
. Shake your mobile device, and BB-8 will do one of 5 random actions - spin twice, vibrate and change his color, move back and forth once, randomly change colors, or nod and shake his head.

[[Activity_7]]
=== 7. Base Infiltration

==== Description

BB-8 is waiting outside an enemy base. When he gets the signal, he will infiltrate the base and find a good spot to spy from. He will need to be completely still, and he will also turn off his bright lights.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_7_final_1>> and <<workshop_7_final_2>>. There is a bit of overlap between the two images; use this to see where the first one ends and the second one starts.

image::images/workshop-7-final-1.png[height=50%]

[[workshop_7_final_2]]
.Activity 7 finished code - part 2
image::images/workshop-7-final-2.png[height=50%]

==== Try it!

. Find a large, empty space for this project.
. Start the project!
. Shake your mobile device to start the "`infiltration`". BB-8 will move around (pretend he is going into a base) and eventually stop. Once he does stop, he will wait until he is completely still before turning his lights off. From this vantage point, he will "`spy on`" the Imperial stormtroopers.

[[Activity_8]]
=== 8. Better Control System

==== Description

BB-8 can connect to a mobile device for control in more than the four cardinal directions. He is using this to help the Resistance gain data about Starkiller Base.

==== Final Code

This project contains three different characters/devices - BB-8, a square button, and a circle button.

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<workshop_8_BB-8>>, the code for the square button should look like <<workshop_8_square_button>>, and the code for the circle button should look like <<workshop_8_circle_button>>.
